# 📚 Library Catalog Management System

📝 
The Library Catalog Management System is a simple, command-line Java application designed to help manage a collection of books in a library. Developed for the TERV Company, this system allows librarians or users to perform basic library operations such as adding new books, searching for books by title, issuing books, and viewing the complete catalog.

This project serves as an introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java, emphasizing real-world modeling with classes and objects. It's ideal for educational purposes, beginner Java developers, or as a base system for more advanced library software.


##💡🎯 Core Features:

1.Add Book:
Allows the user to add a new book to the catalog by entering its title and author.

2.Search Book:
Searches for a book in the catalog by title (case-insensitive). Displays book details if found.

3.Issue Book:

4.Show All Books:
Displays all books in the library catalog, including their issue status.

5.Exit:
Gracefully exits the application.m
